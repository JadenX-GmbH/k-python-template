# Intro
There are 2 signals of vibrations in a machine in a factory. 
From time to time machine breaks because itâ€™s getting into to high vibrations and emergency circuit is turning it off.

## Problem
We suspect that there are some problems with vibrations. 
We gathered data from 2 sensors and we need you to run analysis find the reason for this vibrations

## Sample data
In the Sample Data we have 2 vibrations signals. We discoveered that there is a strong coherence between those signals at 10 Hz. It means that those signals amplify each other and it results in a strong amplification of vibrations for 10 Hz.

## Solution 
We provided you code which can be run in KnowledgeX and for any input it will run coherence anazysis, detect it and plot for you coherence graphs. 

## Transformation of a python code

The initial code of vibrations analysis is in the file `src/initial_app.py` this python app
After following steps in the [tutorial](https://medium.com/knowledgex-data-power/how-to-run-your-python-code-in-knowledgex-749e2651370c) the transformed code is saved in the file `src/app_from_template.py`
